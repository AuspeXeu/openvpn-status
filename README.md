[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/openvpn-status.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/openvpn-status/)

A web-based application to monitor clients connected to an openvpn server.

## Installation
You can either clone the code directly from the repository

``git clone https://github.com/AuspeXeu/openvpn-status.git``

or download it as a zip archive from

[https://github.com/AuspeXeu/openvpn-status/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/AuspeXeu/openvpn-status/archive/master.zip)

or get the latest version by executing the respective ``npm`` command.

``npm install openvpn-status``

## Configuration

The port under which the webinterface is available can be specified inside the ``config.json``, further the location of the openvpn log file can be declared.

```
{
  "port":3013,
  "logFile": "/etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log"
}
```

_(Note: The user running the server needs to have read access to the log file.)_

Moreover you might want to customise the footer inside the ``views``.

```
<p class="text-center" style="font-size:smaller;">

</p> 
```

## Run

In order to run the server you can either navigate to ``/node_modules/openvpn-status`` and run it in the foreground

``node server``

or run it like a deamon by using ``pm2`` to do so we first need to install pm2 using either locally or globally whichever you prefer. For a local installation simply omit the -g flag.

``npm install pm2 -g``

After that you can execute the bash script ``pm2 start pm2.json`` inside the installation directory.

## Running the service behind nginx as a reverse proxy (optional)

In order to integrate the service into your webserver you might want to use nginx as a reverse proxy. The following configuration assumes that the port is set to *3013* as it is by default. The example also contains basic HTTP authentication to protect the service from unauthorised access.

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name [domain];

  auth_basic "Restricted";
  auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/cred/.status;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3013;
  }
}
```
